It's been a while, but here we are with Part 2 of *Understanding C++ Modules*!

In the previous post we covered the very basics of C++ modules, but there are
still important things that need to be discussed.

(The posting of this article on April 1st is purely an accident in being to
lazy to get it out sooner, and not wanting to delay it further. There will be
no April Fool's goofs in this page.)

This post will focus on what may be the most cursed keyword in the C++
language...

# `export`

C++'s `export` keyword was originally meant to permit the separation of the
definition of a template from its usages. It proved to be incredibly difficult
to implement, and the "`export` templates" C++ feature was dropped in C++11,
having never seen widespread usage.

It remained a reserved identifier for several years, and now it returns with
renewed purpose and meaning for C++ Modules.


## The New and Improved (and Completely Repurposed) `export`

The `export` keyword may only be used in a module *interface* unit. The keyword
is attached to a declaration of an entity, and causes that declaration (and
sometimes the definition) to become *visible* to module importers.

(The only weird one is the `export` keyword in the module-declaration, which is
just a re-use of the keyword and does not actually "export" any entities.)


## What Can I `export`?

This isn't the wild west, and `export` isn't free to be plastered everywhere,
namely:

1. You cannot export entities with *internal* linkage (`static` variables and
   functions; and functions, variables, and classes defined within an anonymous
   namespace):

   ```c++
   namespace {

   // ILLEGAL! This is an anonymous namespace
   export void do_stuff() {
       // ...
   }

   // ILLEGAL! This is an anonymous namespace
   export int five = 5;

   // ILLEGAL! This is an anonymous namespace
   export class stuff {
       // ...
   };

   }

   // ILLEGAL! This is declared `static`
   export static void do_more_stuff() {
       // ...
   }

   // ILLEGAL! This is declared `static`
   export static int twelve = 12;
   ```

2. An exported declaration must actually *declare* something.
3. The first declaration of an exported entity **must** be an exported
   declaration. Subsequent declarations and definitions need not have the
   `export` keyword:

   ```c++
   export class Thing;  // Good

   export class Thing;  // Okay, but redundant

   class Thing;  // Implicit `export` keyword

   class Thing { // Implicit `export` keyword
       int a;
       int b;
   };

   class SomethingElse; // Good. Not exported.

   export class SomethingElse; // Illegal! First declaration is not exported!
   ```

4. Exported declarations may only appear at namespace-scope (this includes the
   global namespace).

   ```c++
   export class Stuff { // Okay
       int a;
       int b;
   };

   export class MoreStuff {
       int a;
       export int b; // lolwut? Illegal.
   };

   export void foo() {
       export int value = get_value(); // wat. No!
   }

   export void bar(export std::string name) { // Please reconsider.
       // ...
   }

   template <export typename T>  // plz stop
   export class my_container {};
   ```

5. A `using`-declaration may be exported *unless* the referred entity has
   *internal* or *module* linkage. ("module linkage" will be covered in a
   future post). A `using namespace` declaration cannot be exported.

   ```c++
   namespace Stuff {
   export class Widget {};

   class Gadget {};

   namespace {

   class Gizmo {};

   } // namespace
   } // namespace Stuff

   export using Stuff::Widget; // Okay

   export using Stuff::Gadget; // Not okay
   export using Stuff::Gizmo; // Bad
   export using namespace Stuff; // Nope

   ```

6. A `namespace` definition or linkage-specification block may be exported, but
   all entities declared within the corresponding declaration block must adhere
   to the above rules.

   ```c++
   export namespace foo {

   int eight = 8; // Okay. `eight` is exported as `foo::eight`.

   static int nine = 0; // Illegal!

   namespace {

   void do_stuff() { // Stop! You have violated the law. Pay the court a fine or serve your sentence! Your stolen goods are now forfeit.

   }

   }

   }
   ```

   Note that this rule only applies to the declaration block immediately
   following the export declaration. *This* is permissible:

   ```c++

   export namespace foo {

   int two = 2; // Okay

   }

   namespace foo {

   static int six = 6; // Also okay!
   // ^ This is not within an exported namespace definition, even though the
   // containing namespace `foo` itself is exported by another namespace
   // definition

   }

   ```

7. In addition to exporting namespaces definitions and linkage specification
   blocks, one can also use a bare `export` block:

   ```c++
   export {

   class Aardvark;

   void eat_ants(Aardvark&);

   }
   ```

   Everything within an export block is exported. An `export` block does not introduce a new scope or change the linkage of its contents. The contents of an `export` block must follow the same rules as an exported namespace definition (all contained declarations must be exportable).

<div class="aside note" markdown="1">
Aside: A strange (and unfortunate) side-effect of combining rule #6 with rule #2: `static_assert` may not appear within an exported namespace definition. Despite looking like a statement, `static_assert` is defined as a declaration within the C++ grammar, which permits it to appear in any place that a declaration is valid (otherwise you could not assert at namespace scope or within the body of a class definition). Because `static_assert` does not declare a named entity, exporting a `static_assert` violates rule #2. Because rule #6 requires all declarations within the namespace definition to be exportable, and `static_assert` is not exportable, we find that `static_assert` may not appear within an exported namespace definition. This is a very strange quirk, and to the best of my knowledge there is some effort to add an exception for`static_assert`.
</div>

There are a few more important restrictions on `export`, but they will be
covered in a later post. This current understanding will work for now.


## Implicit `export`-ing

There are two important cases where an entity is implicitly exported because of the exported-ness of a separate entity:

1. An `export`ed namespace definition or linkage-specification-block causes
   *every* declaration within the immediately following declaration block to be exported.

   ```c++
   export namespace Things {

   class Widget { // Implicitly exported as `Things::Widget`

   };

   void foo() { // Implicitly exported as `Things::foo`

   }

   }

   namespace Items {
   export extern "C" {

   void do_stuff(); // Implicitly exported as Items::do_stuff

   }
   export extern "C++" {

   void do_other_things(); // Implicitly exported as Items::do_other_things

   }
   }
   ```

2. An exported entity implicitly exports the containing namespace:

   ```c++
   namespace baz {

   export void quux(); // Exported as baz::quux, and namespace `baz` is now exported

   }
   ```

**Note** that having an exported declaration within a namespace definition is **not the same** as having `export` on the namespace definition:

```c++
namespace europe {

export class france; // `europe::france` is exported,
                     // and namespace `europe` is exported.

class italy; // Not exported, even though the namespace is exported.

namespace {

class germany; // Perfectly legal. This is not an
               // attempt to export an entity with
               // internal linkage.

static_assert(true, "Sane"); // Okay.

}

}
```

Read this as: `europe` is an *exported namespace*, and its namespace definition
contains exported entities, but the above is not an *exported namespace
definition*.


## `export import`?

In the last post, we saw `export import` used with module partitions:

```c++
export module my_module;
// Add `some_partition` to our module interface:
export import :some_partition;
```

But `export import` may also appear on regular imports:

```c++
export module my_module;

export import widgets_inc;
```

The result is that users who import `my_module` will "implicitly" import
`widgets_inc`. This relationship is fully transitive.


# Rules Regarding `import`

`export` has been a reserved word for many years, but now we have a new
contextual keyword: `import`. We've seen it quite a bit, and it is mostly
self-explanatory.

However, just like with `export`, there are some rules about using `import`:

1. In a module unit, all `import`s **must** appear *before* any declarations in
   that module unit. You cannot `import` at arbitrary points in a module unit.

   ```c++
   export module yo;

   import dogs;

   void pet(dog& d);

   import cats; // Not allowed! Move this import above `pet`
   ```

   `import` is a special identifier, and it is still possible to use `import`
   as a name for other entities:

   ```c++
   export module yo;

   import dogs;

   class import {};

   import i1; // Illegal! `import` declarations must appear in the preamble
   ::import i2; // Okay. Declares a variable `i2` of type `import`.

   class Widget {
       import member; // Okay. No scope-resolution needed.
   };
   ```

   In a non-module translation unit, `import` may appear after declarations in
   the translation unit.
2. `import` declarations may only appear at global scope.
3. An `import` that names a module partition may only name partitions that
   belong to the same module which contains the `import`.
4. A module may not `import` itself.
5. A module unit `A` may not have an *interface dependency* on itself (a cyclic
   import) (see below regarding "interface dependencies).

> Even though you are still able to use `import` as an identifier, please don't,
> for the sake of our (and your own) sanity.

(As far as this author can determine, a namespace-scope declaration of
unqualified type `import` or function returning unqualified type `import` is
the only instance of C++ Modules breaking existing code.)


## The Implicit `import`

There is one scenario in which an `import` implicitly occurs:

```c++
// europe.cpp
export module europe;

struct Country {};
struct France;
struct Germany;
```

```c++
// europe_impl.cpp
module europe;

struct France : Country {};
struct Germany : Country {};
```

If you recognize this from the prior post, I referred to such module units as
`europe_impl.cpp` as *anonymous* implementation units. This name isn't a name
provided by the standard document, but I find it a useful shorthand when
talking about "module implementation units that are not partitions."

You'll notice above that `europe_impl.cpp` refers to `struct Country` in the
definitions of `France` and `Germany`, but it never imports anything!

"Anonymous" module implementation units are defined to have an "implicit"
import of the module in which they belong. In fact: Adding an `import europe`
*is not allowed* (and, because of the implicit import, not necessary).

You might think this could create a cyclic import, but it cannot: There is no
way for any other module unit to import an implementation unit with no
partition name. Its contents are *unreachable* from any other translation unit.
Even the rest of `europe` cannot get at the contents of this file. Only within
`europe_impl.cpp` will `France` and `Germany` be complete types (they will be
seen as incomplete types everywhere else).


## Interface Dependencies

This aspect is best explained by simply pasting the relevant text from the
specification:

> A translation unit has an *interface dependency* on a module unit `U` if it
> contains a module-declaration or module-import-declaration that imports `U`
> or if it has an interface dependency on a module unit that has an interface
> dependency on `U`.

Suppose the following program:

```c++
// a.cpp
export module Foo;
```

```c++
// b.cpp
export module Bar;

import Foo;
```

```c++
// c.cpp
import Bar;
```

`c.cpp` has an *interface dependency* on `b.cpp` by virtue of importing the
module of which that module unit is a member. Even though it does not name
`a.cpp` or the module thereof, it *does* have an interface dependency on
`a.cpp` because `a.cpp` is an interface dependency of `b.cpp`. Interface
dependencies are transitive.


# The Dungeon Boss: `visible` versus `reachable`

C++ Modules introduces two new concepts: *visibility* and *reachability*, which
help distinguish between what code is semantically valid in the face of
(possibly implicitly) imported constructs.


## What is *Visibility*?

Let's look at the simplest *visibility* rule of all:

```c++
// main.cpp

#include <iostream>

const char* get_phrase() {
    return "Hello, world!";
}

int main() {
    std::cout << get_phrase() << '\n';
}
```

We're not even using any module features here, but the rules of *visibility*
and *reachability* have an effect on all code. In this sample, `get_phrase` is
(obviously) "visible" from `main`.

A name is *visible* at a point within a translation unit if that name has been
declared at an earlier point within the same translation unit. This is
unchanged from C++17: **Namespace-scope declarations are *still* not
"hoisted"!**

There are other situations in which *visibility* comes into play:

```c++
export module speech;

export const char* get_phrase() {
    return "Hello, world!";
}
```

```c++
// main.cpp
import speech;

import <iostream>;

int main() {
    std::cout << get_phrase() << '\n';
}
```

In this sample, `get_phrase` is *visible* within `main.cpp` because of the
`import speech;` declaration.

"Visible" means "a candidate for name lookup." Visibility applies to more than
just namespace-scope items:


```c++
export module speech;

export struct Phrase {
    const char* spelling = nullptr;
};

export Phrase get_phrase() {
    return Phrase{"Hello, world!"};
}
```

```c++
// main.cpp
import speech;

import <iostream>;

int main() {
    Phrase phr = get_phrase();
    std::cout << phr.spelling << '\n';
}
```

In this sample, `Phrase::spelling` is *also* visible, which allows us to ask
for the member when we have an instance of that object.


## A Trickier Beast: *Reachability*

C++ Modules introduce a new concept of *reachability*. When an entity is
*reachable*, the semantic properties of that entity are available, but not
necessarily visible to name lookup. It is **essential** to understand the
following:

1. Every *visible* entity is also *reachable*.
2. Being *reachable* does not imply being *visible*.
3. Whether an entity is declared with `export` **has no effect** on if it is
   *reachable*: It only effects whether it is *visible*.
4. If a class or enumeration type is *reachable*, then its members become
   *visible*, even if the containing name is not visible.

Point 4 has some interesting implications: We can have access to the semantic
properties and member names of a class *even if we cannot name that class*.

This allows for some crazy *1337 h4cks*:

```c++
export module Secrets;

// NOT EXPORTED!
class SecretClass {
public:
    explicit SecretClass(int i) : value(i) {}
    SecretClass(const SecretClass&) = delete;
    SecretClass(SecretClass&&) = default;

    int value = 0;
};

// Export a function that returns our non-exported class type
export SecretClass get_secret() {
    return SecretClass{42};
}
```

```c++
import Secrets;

void foo() {
    // ILLEGAL: `SecretClass` is not visible:
    SecretClass s1 = get_secret();

    // Okay: `SecretClass`'s move-constructor is *reachable*:
    auto s2 = get_secret();

    // Okay: The members of the class are *visible*
    int secret_value = s2.value;

    // ILLEGAL: `SecretClass` is not copyable:
    auto s3 = s2;

    // Okay: A move-construction of `SecretClass`:
    auto s4 = std::move(s2);

    // WHOA: Okay: Grab the class and give it a name.
    using NamedClass = decltype(s2);

    // Okay: The constructor of `SecretClass` is reachable, and we've now got
    // a name on the class.
    NamedClass s5{53};
}
```

You might believe that this is wildly unprecedented, but we've had a similar
concept of "usable but not visible" since C++14, no modules required:

```c++
auto foo() {
    struct Money {
        int amount;
    };
    return Money{ 12 };
}

int bar() {
    auto f = foo();
    using SecretType = decltype(f);
    SecretType my_money{34};
    return my_money.amount; // Returns 34!
}
```

### The Easy Case: *Necessary* Reachability

The standard specifies a sub-category of reachability called *necessary*
reachability. Being *necessarily reachable* is an attribute of a translation
unit and propagates to the entities declared within it (with some limitations,
explored in a later post).

The rules of *necessary* reachability are simple: A translation unit is
necessarily reachable *if and only if* it is a module **interface** unit on
which the requesting translation unit has an interface dependency.

```c++
// eurasia_base.cpp
export module eurasia:base;

import <string>;

struct Country {
    std::string common_lang;
};
```

```c++
// eurasia_west.cpp
export module eurasia:west;

import :base;

struct Spain : Country {
    Spain() : Country{"es"} {}
};
struct France : Country {
    France() : Country{"fr"} {}
};
```

```c++
// eurasia_east.cpp
export module eurasia:east;

import :base;

struct Japan : Country {
    Japan() : Country{"jp"} {}
};
struct Russia : Country {
    Russia() : Country{"ru"} {}
};
```

```c++
// eurasia.cpp
export module eurasia;

import <memory>;

import export :base;
import export :east;
import export :west;

export const Country& get_country() {
    // ...
}
```

```c++
// main.cpp
import eurasia;

import <iostream>;

int main() {
    auto& c = get_country();
    std::cout << "Country language is " << c.common_lang << '\n';
}
```

Even though `Country` is not exported (nor visible), `c.common_lang` is valid
for the following reasons:

1. Every module unit in `eurasia` is an interface dependency of `main.cpp`.
2. All partitions in `eurasia` are *interface* partitions
3. Therefore: every module unit (and the things declared within) are
   *necessarily* reachable from `main.cpp`.
4. By being reachable, the members of `Country` become *visible* to `main.cpp`.

The name of "necessary" reachability is to convey the idea that these rules
enforce a baseline behavior for the propagation of semantic properties between
translation units in a modularized program.

So... What would be "unecessarily" reachable?

That's *implementation defined*. Brace yourself.


### GOTCHA!

An astute observer will notice that the partitions `:base`, `:east`, and
`:west` do not actually export anything, despite themselves being *interface*
partitions (with the `export module` declaration).

You might therefore assume it safe to simply remove the `export` keyword from
the module declaration, right?

Not so fast!

Remember the rule of necessary reachability:

> A translation unit is necessarily reachable *if and only if it* is a module
> **interface** unit on which the requesting translation unit has an interface
> dependency.

Note that this only applies to *interface* module units. If we remove the
`export` keyword from the module declaration, the module partition becomes an
*implementation* partition.

The standard goes on to say this:

> It is unspecified whether additional translation units on which the [...]
> [translation unit] has an interface dependency are considered reachable, and
> under what circumstances.

[The edits and elisions will be covered in a later post.]

It also features two non-normative notes:

> Implementations are therefore not required to prevent the semantic effects of
> additional translation units involved in the compilation from being observed.

> It is advisable to avoid depending on the reachability of any additional
> translation units in programs intending to be portable.

This means that removing the `export` keyword in the declaration
`export module eurasia:base;` *might* or *might not* break `main.cpp`!

We haven't much deployment experience to say whether this caveat will be
extremely relevant, and it only manifests in an already-fairly-contorted
program.

Nevertheless: Heed this warning: Do not depend on arbitrary things being
*reachable* beyond what is *necessarily* reachable.


# A Short Reprieve

Would you believe there is still more to cover? Well, there is! It'll have to
wait for another day, though. In part three we'll cover some still
less-well-known features and facts about C++ modules. Hopefully you won't have
to wait an entire month to see it.

## **CAUTION**:

This section discusses an aspect of C++ Modules that is still under
construction, but it can be used to give a good glance into the nitty-gritty
details of the kind of problems that C++ Modules has to solve.

The particular aspect discussed here will almost certainly be changed before
the final Standard ships.

If you don't care to see what may never be (or if you want to sleep peacefully
tonight) then skipping this section is recommended. Consider this your warning.
</div>

We know that we cannot `export` entities with internal linkage. It is
explicitly banned:

```c++
export module Foo;

namespace {
export class LolWatchThis {  // NOPE!
    static void say_hello() {
        std::cout << "Hello, everyone!\n";
    }
};
}
```

`LolWatchThis` has "internal" linkage, and it is not allowed to be `export`ed.
In addition, its definitions are not visible to external translation units,
unless...

```c++
export module Foo;

import <iostream>;

namespace {
class LolWatchThis {
    static void say_hello() {
        std::cout << "Hello, everyone!\n";
    }
};
}

export LolWatchThis lolwut() {
    return LolWatchThis();
}
```

```c++
// main.cpp
import Foo;

int main() {
    auto evil = lolwut();
    decltype(evil)::say_hello(); // WORKS ??
}
```

This is a phenomenon known as *linkage promotion*, discussed in
[p1395](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p1395r0.pdf).

<div class="image-frame limmy" markdown="1">
<img alt="I Don't Get It" src="res/limmy.jpg" limmy>
</div>

If you find this weird and frightening: You're in good company. This behavior
will almost certainly be changed with the adoption of
[p1498](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p1498r1.html),
which proposes to restrict the usage of TU-local (internal linkage) entities
within contexts in which the definition may need to be exposed. Directly
exposing internal entities to the outside world would be restricted (returning a
TU-local type), but so would usage of those names in which the definition might
leak silently (i.e. `inline` functions, even if the `inline` is implicit (e.g.
function templates, in-class definitions of member functions, `constexpr` and
`consteval` functions)).

A related paper, [p1604](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p1604r0.html), could tweak the meaning and/or occurrence of implicit
`inline`, which could have a huge effect on the restrictions of p1498. I won't
write more here, as these changes are still in flight. A much-much later post
may follow up on the resolutions to these issues.
